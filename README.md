## Challenges Faced

### Learning Responsive Design:

Mastering the art of responsive design presented an initial challenge. Delving into CSS media queries and flexible layouts helped overcome this hurdle.

### Implementing CSS Animations:

Integrating animations seamlessly within the webpage using only CSS required a deep dive into keyframes, transitions, and transform properties. Online resources and experimentation played a crucial role in the learning process.

### Cross-Browser Compatibility:

Ensuring consistent performance across various browsers posed challenges. Regular testing and adjustments were necessary to guarantee a smooth user experience.

### Optimizing Page Load Speed:

Addressing concerns about page load speed demanded optimization techniques. Compressing images, leveraging browser caching, and minimizing HTTP requests were key strategies employed to enhance performance.

### Enhancing Accessibility:

Ensuring the web page is accessible to users with disabilities presented a learning curve. Incorporating semantic HTML, ARIA roles, and testing with accessibility tools contributed to making the page more inclusive.

### Debugging and Browser DevTools:

Debugging CSS and HTML issues using browser developer tools was essential. Familiarizing myself with the tools available in Chrome, Firefox, and other browsers improved efficiency in identifying and resolving bugs.
